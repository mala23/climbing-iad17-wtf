    <h2>How the tri-disciplinary Olympic Competition works</h2>
    <p>The competition format for the Olympic Games 2020 was conceived of specifically for the Olympics. So far it was deployed only at the World Cup 2018  and at the Juniors World Cup 2017 in Innsbruck.</p>
    <p>All athletes compete in fixed succession in the three disciplines Lead, Bouldering and Speed. The respective rankings are multiplied and the athlete reaching the lowest score qualifies for the finals. The finals consist of climbing all three disciplines in succession.</p>
