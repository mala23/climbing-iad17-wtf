      Lead climbing is about climbing to the top while clipping all quickdraws within 6 minutes. The wall is about 15 meters high. The route is considered ‘topped’ when the final quickdraw is clipped and the climber holds the top hold with both hands. If a climber falls, the height climbed counts. Another attempt is not possible. If two climbers reach the same height, the quicker one wins.
